# MagicScanner Backend

Python FastAPI backend for detecting and identifying Magic: The Gathering cards using computer vision and perceptual hashing.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multi-Card Detection**: Detect and extract multiple cards from a single image
- **Perceptual Hash Matching**: Identify cards regardless of lighting, angle, or minor variations
- **Scryfall Integration**: Fetch card details and prices from Scryfall API
- **Fast & Scalable**: Async API design with rate limiting
- **Railway Ready**: Pre-configured for easy Railway deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Backend Flow:
1. Receive image from mobile app
2. OpenCV detects individual cards in image
3. Each card is perspective-corrected and extracted
4. Perceptual hash (pHash) is calculated for each card
5. Match against pre-built database of 20,000+ card hashes
6. Fetch current details and prices from Scryfall
7. Return results to mobile app
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graphicpoint/magic-scanner-backend.git
cd magic-scanner-backend
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create venv
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Build Card Database

**IMPORTANT**: Before the API can identify cards, you need to build the hash database.

**Option A: Test Database (Recommended for development)**

```bash
# Build small database with 100 cards (~5 minutes)
python build_card_database.py --test
```

**Option B: Full Database (For production)**

```bash
# Build complete database with all cards (~3-4 hours)
python build_card_database.py

# WARNING: This downloads ~100MB JSON + several GB of card images
```

The database will be saved to `cache/card_hashes.pkl`

### 5. Run the Server

```bash
# Start the API server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at:
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health: http://localhost:8000/health

## 📡 API Endpoints

### GET `/`
Health check endpoint
```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "service": "MagicScanner API",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### GET `/health`
Detailed health check including database status

### POST `/scan`
Scan an image containing multiple Magic cards

**Request:**
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Body: Image file (JPEG, PNG)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cards_found": 12,
  "cards_matched": 11,
  "cards": [
    {
      "card_number": 1,
      "matched": true,
      "confidence": 95,
      "name": "Lightning Bolt",
      "set": "Alpha",
      "set_code": "lea",
      "rarity": "common",
      "image_url": "https://...",
      "scryfall_id": "...",
      "prices": {
        "usd": "2.50",
        "usd_foil": null,
        "eur": "2.00",
        "tix": "0.50"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST `/identify-single`
Identify a single card from an image

Same format as `/scan` but optimized for single card recognition.

### GET `/database/stats`
Get statistics about the loaded card database

## 🧪 Testing

### Test with cURL

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Scan cards
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/scan \
  -F "file=@path/to/cards-image.jpg"
```

### Test with Python

```python
import requests

# Upload image
with open('cards.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:8000/scan',
        files={'file': f}
    )
    
print(response.json())
```

## 🚂 Railway Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. [Railway account](https://railway.app)
2. GitHub account connected to Railway
3. This repository pushed to your GitHub

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

2. **Create Railway Project**
- Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Choose `magic-scanner-backend`

3. **Configure Environment**
Railway will automatically:
- Detect Python project
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Use start command from `railway.toml`

4. **Build Database on Railway**

After first deployment, you need to build the card database on Railway:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run database build
railway run python build_card_database.py --test

# For production, build full database:
# railway run python build_card_database.py
```

**Note**: Building the full database on Railway may take several hours and consume significant bandwidth. Consider building locally and uploading the cache file instead.

5. **Get Your API URL**

Railway will provide a public URL like:
```
https://magic-scanner-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

Use this URL in your mobile app!

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Currently no required environment variables, but you can configure:
- `CACHE_DIR`: Custom cache directory path
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug logging

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No cards detected in image"

**Causes:**
- Image quality too low
- Cards too small in frame
- Poor lighting or contrast
- Cards overlapping

**Solutions:**
- Ensure cards are clearly visible
- Use good lighting
- Take photo from directly above
- Keep cards separated

### "Card database not loaded"

**Cause:** Hash database hasn't been built

**Solution:**
```bash
python build_card_database.py --test
```

### "Could not identify card"

**Causes:**
- Card not in database (very new/obscure)
- Image quality issues
- Damaged or altered card

**Solutions:**
- Ensure database is up to date
- Try better photo
- Check if card exists on Scryfall

### OpenCV Errors on Mac

If you get OpenCV errors related to libpng or libjpeg:

```bash
brew install libpng libjpeg
pip install --upgrade opencv-python-headless
```

## 📊 Performance

### Database Size
- **Test database** (100 cards): ~500KB
- **Full database** (20,000+ cards): ~50-100MB

### API Response Times
- Card detection: ~200-500ms
- Hash matching: ~50-200ms per card
- Scryfall fetch: ~100-300ms per card
- **Total for 12 cards**: ~2-5 seconds

### Accuracy
- Cards in good condition: >95% accuracy
- Worn/damaged cards: ~85% accuracy
- Non-English cards: ~90% accuracy

## 🔐 Security Notes

- No authentication required (add if needed for production)
- CORS enabled for all origins (restrict in production)
- Rate limiting on Scryfall requests (10 req/sec)
- No user data stored
